CodenameDeliveryBoy
===================
This project contains all the files for my thesis at AAU.  All the code was written by me over about a year and a half leading up to the final presentation.  

Some of the features created include: 
- Third person camera and locomotion system
- Cover System (hold space when facing a wall)
- Ai zombie characters that can follow and attack the player
- Mechanim animation blending
- Day/Night cycle (only on PC, not in HTML 5 yet)
- time scaling
- Simple quest and inventory systems

A few changes have been made since then to fix bugs during the upgrade to Unity 5.
